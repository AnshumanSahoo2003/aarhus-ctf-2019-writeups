Writeups for Aarhus CTF 2019. You can contribute by sending a PR or by contacting us on info@aarhus-ctf.dk. We prefer the [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) format, but you are free to choose any format.

You are also welcome to create an issue, where you put the contents of your writeup including any files and images, then we will incorporate it. This might be the easiest option
